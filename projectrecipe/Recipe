 kadai.

 3)Keep the pan on a low to medium-low flame. stir at intervals so that the milk does not stick at the bottom 
 of the pan.

 4) Let the milk come to a boil.

 5) Take 1 tablespoon milk from the pan in a small bowl. Let the milk become warm. Then add a few saffron 
 strands in the milk. Keep aside.

 6)After the milk begins to boil, drain all the water from the rice and add it to the hot boiling milk.

 7)Mix very well.

 8)Simmer and cook rice on a low flame. No need to cover the pan when the rice is cooking.
